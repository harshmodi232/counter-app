# React + Vite

Project Name: Counter App
Technologies Used: React.js, Tailwind CSS
Description: Developed a responsive Counter App using React.js for dynamic UI updates and Tailwind CSS for efficient styling. Implemented state management with React Hooks to handle increment, decrement, and reset functionalities. Ensured a clean and modern UI with Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach. The project demonstrates fundamental React concepts, including component-based architecture and event handling.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
